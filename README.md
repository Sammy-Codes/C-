Projects

1- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. The project that I am writing about is the Fahrenheit to Celsius program. This program takes the temperature from a city and converts it from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

2 - What did you do particularly well? What I did great in this project was the conversion formula that I had to use to get the input from the user and actually getting the right calculation.

3 - Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? I could have enhance my code in the area where I had to output the results of the code and make it more user friendly and easier for them to read.

4 - Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? The pieces of code that I found the most challenging to write was finding the formula to use when converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. Certain tools I can use is finding the right formula to use is youtube or any helpful math resource for finding the right conversion.

5 - What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? The skills that I think would be the most transferable is input and output from user which helps with syntax and about every program has this in its programs.

6 - How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I made this code readable by organizing my code and using indentions to make it easier for any programmer to read the code that I have. I believe it is important part of being a programmer.
